When fine-grained access control is enabled and a client uses Grafana API Key to make requests, the permissions for that API Key are cached for 30 seconds for the given organization. Because of the way the cache ID is constructed, the consequent requests with any API Key evaluate to the same permissions as the previous requests. This can lead to an escalation of privileges, when for example a first request is made with Admin permissions, and the second request with different API Key is made with Viewer permissions, the second request will get the cached permissions from the previous Admin, essentially accessing higher privilege than it should. The vulnerability is only impacting Grafana Enterprise when the fine-grained access control beta feature is enabled and there are more than one API Keys in one organization with different roles assigned. All installations after Grafana Enterprise v8.1.0-beta1 should be upgraded as soon as possible.

When the TCP sequence is predictable, an attacker can send packets that are forged to appear to come from a trusted computer. These forged packets could compromise services on the MSC800. SICK has released a new firmware version of the SICK MSC800 and recommends updating to the newest version.","Date":"2022-04-11 20:15:00+00:00","URL":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27577","HasCVSS":true,"CVSS":9.1,"Impacts":"?"},{"Source":"nist.gov","Title":"Information exposure vulnerability in Samsung DeX Home prior to SMR April-2022 Release 1 allows to access currently launched foreground app information without permission","Date":"2022-04-11 20:15:00+00:00","URL":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27576","HasCVSS":true,"CVSS":3.3,"Impacts":"?"},{"Source":"nist.gov","Title":"Information exposure vulnerability in One UI Home prior to SMR April-2022 Release 1 allows to access currently launched foreground app information without permission.","Date":"2022-04-11 20:15:00+00:00","URL":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27575","HasCVSS":true,"CVSS":3.3,"Impacts":"?"},{"Source":"nist.gov","Title":"Improper input validation vulnerability in parser_iloc and sheifd_find_itemIndexin fuctions of libsimba library prior to SMR Apr-2022 Release 1 allows out of bounds write by privileged attacker.","Date":"2022-04-11 20:15:00+00:00","URL":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27574","HasCVSS":true,"CVSS":7.2,"Impacts":"?"},{"Source":"nist.gov","Title":"Improper input validation vulnerability in parser_infe and sheifd_find_itemIndexin fuctions of libsimba library prior to SMR Apr-2022 Release 1 allows out of bounds write by privileged attackers.","Date":"2022-04-11 20:15:00+00:00","URL":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27573","HasCVSS":true,"CVSS":7.2,"Impacts":"?"},{"Source":"nist.gov","Title":"Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in parser_ipma function of libsimba library prior to SMR Apr-2022 Release 1 allows code execution by remote attackers.","Date":"2022-04-11 20:15:00+00:00","URL":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27572","HasCVSS":true,"CVSS":9.8,"Impacts":"?"},{"Source":"nist.gov","Title":"Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in sheifd_get_info_image function in libsimba library prior to SMR Apr-2022 Release 1 allows code execution by remote attacker.","Date":"2022-04-11 20:15:00+00:00","URL":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27571","HasCVSS":true,"CVSS":9.8,"Impacts":"?"},{"Source":"nist.gov","Title":"Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in parser_single_iref function in libsimba library prior to SMR Apr-2022 Release 1 allows code execution by remote attacker.","Date":"2022-04-11 20:15:00+00:00","URL":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27570","HasCVSS":true,"CVSS":9.8,"Impacts":"?"},{"Source":"nist.gov","Title":"Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in parser_infe function in libsimba library prior to SMR Apr-2022 Release 1 allows code execution by remote attacker.","Date":"2022-04-11 20:15:00+00:00","URL":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27569","HasCVSS":true,"CVSS":9.8,"Impacts":"?"},{"Source":"nist.gov","Title":"Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in parser_iloc function in libsimba library prior to SMR Apr-2022 Release 1 allows code execution by remote attacker.","Date":"2022-04-11 20:15:00+00:00","URL":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27568","HasCVSS":true,"CVSS":9.8,"Impacts":"?"},{"Source":"nist.gov","Title":"Null pointer dereference vulnerability in parser_hvcC function of libsimba library prior to SMR Apr-2022 Release 1 allows out of bounds write by remote attackers.","Date":"2022-04-11 20:15:00+00:00","URL":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27567","HasCVSS":true,"CVSS":9.8,"Impacts":"?"},{"Source":"nist.gov","Title":"A maliciously crafted DWFX and SKP files in Autodesk Navisworks 2022 can be used to trigger use-after-free vulnerability.
